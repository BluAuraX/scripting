	document.getElementById('output').innerHTML="A "+ad1+" "+ani1+" once set off into the city of Chicago searching for food. He was chilly, hungry, and craving for something to eat as he hadn't eaten anything for months. There was a strange noise heard from a small cabin nearby. The "+ani1+" was curious, he couldn’t resist the urge of finding a tasty snack. His curiosity persuaded him to "+ver+" towards the cabin. As he arrived, the door was locked. He could still hear the sounds coming from within the cabin. It sounded as if someone was playing video games. The "+ani1+" couldn’t handle the temptation of finding a meal, so he started punching the cabin door. A few furious punches wouldn’t even budge the door open, so he started kicking. While progressively kicking and punching the cabin door, the human inside became wary of the intruder. He turned off his video games and walked towards the door asking who was at the door. No response was given, so he began shouting “Hello!?”. The "+ani1+" used much more force when he heard the person speaking out loud. The human was terrified, he couldn’t move a muscle. He was unsure if it was even a human being at the front door. He was indecisive about what to do. Extremely hesitant to open the door, he grabbed his cell phone and attempted to call the police. As he dialed 911, the door bursts open and the bear meets the human. It was a bearded young man who looked like he was in his early 20s. The man violently screams, throws his phone in the air, and runs towards the back exit. The "+ani1+" chases him out the door and follows him outside. The man races to his "+rid+" and quickly shuts the door. He swiftly drives off, leaving the bear behind. Disappointed that he couldn’t catch his prey, the "+ani1+" re-enters the cabin. He finds a box of pizza lying beside the couch where the man’s video games were. He grabs a slice and departs the cabin. ";
